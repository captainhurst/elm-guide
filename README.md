# Examples From The Elm Guide

I am recreating these examples (often a copy and paste) from the guide for Elm.

While my experience coding Elm has so far been fun, following the examples has
been particularly painful as a beginner. Trying to figure out which module
functions are coming from has been a point of frustration. As such, I've decided to
rewrite the examples with only the import of modules so every non-local function
is qualified by it's module. Only local functions and kernel level functions
are callable (i hope) without the `Moduel.function` syntax.

Additionally, I've also added some notes/docs for my own reference.
